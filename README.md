## My process

### Built with

vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. For layout I used flexbox and a couple of media queries to control view on tablets and phone devices.

### What I learned

Okay, this was way harder than I thought, but i managed to finish it, this took me a week to complete since i got stucked on how to do the animation.
Functionality and design were pretty easy to do, but man, the animation!
First of all i wasn't sure on how to do it, then i used the "transition -> transform" property of css, i had to research a little while 'cause i didn't know how to use it properly. 
(I know it's not perfect but i was pretty satisfied with the final result).
The problem that came later was how to code the working animation, i was stucked here like for three days, thinking a way to do it and mostly debugging, finally the light came out to me.
It was pretty fun and so satisfying when it got to work, and i learned a few things more!
